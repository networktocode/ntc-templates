# Extending the Library

Extending the library is welcome, however it is best to open an issue first, to ensure that a PR would be accepted and makes sense in terms of features and design.

Requesting for others to create templates is not currently supported. Please review the [faq](../user/faq.md#does-the-project-support-requests-for-additional-templates-or-additional-data-in-an-existing-template) for more details.
