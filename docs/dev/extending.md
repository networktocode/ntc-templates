# Extending the Library

Extending the library is welcome and in most instances PRs are merged after review. If there is a large quantity of changes or are not backwards compatible, it would be advised to open an issue first to ensure that a PR would be accepted and makes sense in terms of features and design.

Requesting for others to create templates is not currently supported. Please review the [faq](../user/faq.md#does-the-project-support-requests-for-additional-templates-or-additional-data-in-an-existing-template) for more details.
